# Project Description

All assignments (3) will be about the development of different parts of a project. Thus, every assignment
will build upon code developed in previous assignments. You are expected to work in teams of 5 for every
assignment.

## Problem Statement

The specific project for this semester consists of building a simple "Risk" computer game. The developed
program will have to be compatible with the rules of the "Warzone" version of Risk, which can be accessed
at https://www.warzone.com/. A Warzone game consists of a connected graph map representing a world map,
where each node is a territory they own, from which they can attack adjacent territories to conquer them.
The objective of the game is to conquer all territories on the map.
